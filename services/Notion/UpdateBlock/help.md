# Update Notion Block

This connector allows you to update the content of an existing block in Notion.

## How to Use

### Block Identification
- **Block ID or URL**: Enter either the block ID directly or a Notion URL that contains the block ID. The connector will automatically extract the ID from the URL.
  - Example Block ID: `9bc30ad4-9373-46a5-84ab-0a7845ee52e6`
  - Example URL: `https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/9bc30ad4937346a584ab0a7845ee52e6`

### Block Content
- **Block Type**: Select the type of block you want to create.
- **Content**: Enter the text content for your block.
- **Color**: Choose a color for your text (optional).
- **Is Toggleable**: For heading blocks only - make them expandable/collapsible.
- **Checked**: For to-do blocks only - set whether the checkbox is checked.
- **Language**: For code blocks only - specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.
- **Emoji**: For callout blocks only - specify an emoji to display (e.g., üí°, üö®, ‚ÑπÔ∏è).

### Text Formatting
Apply formatting to your text:
- **Bold**: Make text bold
- **Italic**: Make text italic
- **Strikethrough**: Add strikethrough to text
- **Underline**: Underline text
- **Code**: Format text as inline code

### Block Status
- **Archive Block**: Set to "Yes" to archive (delete) the block, or "No" to keep it active.

### Result
- **Output Variable**: Name of the variable where the updated block information will be stored.

## Notes

- You must have appropriate permissions to update the block in Notion.
- Different block types support different properties. For example, "Is Toggleable" only applies to heading blocks.
- The connector will replace the entire content of the block with your new content.
- If you're updating a heading that has children and want to remove the toggle, you must first remove all children blocks.

## Example

To update a heading with green text that says "Project Updates":
1. Enter the block ID or URL
2. Select "Heading 2" as the block type
3. Enter "Project Updates" as the content
4. Select "Green" as the color
5. Choose whether you want it toggleable
6. Name your output variable (e.g., "updatedBlock")
