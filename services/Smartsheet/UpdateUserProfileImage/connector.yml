  description: 'Uploads an image to the user profile. Uploading a profile image differs from Adding an Image to a Cell in the following ways: A Content-Length header is not required Allowable file types are limited to: gif, jpg, and png Maximum file size is determined by the following rules: If you have not defined a custom size and the image is larger than 1050 x 1050 pixels, Smartsheet scales the image down to 1050 x 1050 If you have defined a custom size, Smartsheet uses that as the file size max If the image is not square, Smartsheet uses a solid color to pad the image'
