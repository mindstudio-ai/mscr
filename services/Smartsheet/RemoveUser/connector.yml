User is transitioned to a free collaborator with read-only access to owned reports, sheets, Sights, workspaces, and any shared templates (unless those are optionally transferred to another user). This operation is only available to system administrators If the transferTo parameter is specified and the removed user owns groups, the user specified via the transferTo parameter must have group admin rights. * The transferTo and transferSheets parameters cannot be specified for a user who has not yet accepted an invitation to join the organization account (that is, if user status=PENDING).'
