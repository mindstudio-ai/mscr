  description: |
    Imports CSV or XLSX data into a new sheet in the specified workspace.

    Note the following:
      * Both sheetName and the file name must use ASCII characters.
      * The source data must be basic text. To include rich formula data, import and create a sheet first, and then use Update Rows. To work with images, see Cell Images.
      * XLS is not supported. You must use XLSX.
      * Hierarchical relationships between rows in an external file won't import.
