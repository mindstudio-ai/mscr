  description: 'Imports CSV or XLSX data into a new sheet in the specified workspace. Note the following: Both sheetName and the file name must use ASCII characters. The source data must be basic text. To include rich formula data, import and create a sheet first, and then use Update Rows. To work with images, see Cell Images. XLS is not supported. You must use XLSX. Hierarchical relationships between rows in an external file won''t import.'
