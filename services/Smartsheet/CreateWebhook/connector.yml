  description: 'Creates a new Webhook. A webhook is not enabled by default when it is created. Once you''ve created a webhook, you can enable it by using the Update Webhook operation to set enabled to true. When a row is deleted on a sheet, even if you are using a subscope to monitor columns only and the cell in that column for that row is empty, you will receive a "row.deleted" event.'
