# Search Members

This action allows you to search for subscribers in your MailChimp account by email address, first name, or last name.

## Configuration

### Search Query
Enter the text you want to search for. This can be:
- An email address (e.g., `john@example.com`)
- A first name (e.g., `John`)
- A last name (e.g., `Smith`)

### List ID (Optional)
If you want to search within a specific list, enter the List ID here. You can find your List ID in MailChimp by:
1. Going to Audience â†’ All Contacts
2. Click on "Settings" in the dropdown
3. Click on "Audience name and defaults"
4. The Audience ID is displayed under "Settings" (it looks like `abc123def`)

Leave this field blank to search across all lists in your account.

### Output Variable
Enter a name for the variable that will store the search results. You can reference this variable in subsequent steps of your workflow.

## Output Format

The output will be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "exactMatches": [...],     // Array of members that exactly match your query
  "partialMatches": [...],   // Array of members that partially match your query
  "totalExactMatches": 1,    // Count of exact matches
  "totalPartialMatches": 5   // Count of partial matches
}
```

Each member object contains information such as email address, name, subscription status, and other profile data.
