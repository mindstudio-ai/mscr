# Import Design to Canva

This connector allows you to import external files as new designs in Canva.

## What You'll Need

## Supported File Types

Canva supports importing various file types, including:
- PDF documents
- Images (JPEG, PNG)

## Configuration

### File URL
Enter the URL of the file you want to import. This must be a publicly accessible URL.

Example: `https://example.com/myfile.pdf`

### Design Title
Enter a title for your new Canva design. This will be visible in your Canva account.

Example: `My Awesome Design üòç`

### File Type
Select the MIME type of the file you're importing. If you're unsure, select "Auto-detect" and Canva will attempt to determine the file type automatically.
