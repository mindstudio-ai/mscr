Here are some of the things you can do:\n\n- Read and update sheets\n- Manage folders and workspaces\n- Administer Smartsheet plans and user accounts\n\nThe [API resource specification](/#section/RESOURCES) includes object schemas, method specifications, and code snippets for [Folders](/#tag/foldersDescription), [Sheets](/#tag/sheetsDescription), [Cells](/#tag/cellsDescription), and more.\n\n> **IMPORTANT:**\n> * The Smartsheet API is restricted to users on Business and Enterprise plans\n> * The [Developer Agreement](https://www.smartsheet.com/legal/developer-program-agreement) governs the use of the Smartsheet API and Smartsheet software development kits (SDKs)\n\nLet's start with the essentials.\n\n### Base URL\n\n`https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0`\n\n### Authentication\n\nThe API authenticates using access tokens (API keys). You can [generate access tokens](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2482389-generate-API-key) in the Smartsheet UI.\n\nEach API request requires passing in an access token as the `Bearer` value in your authorization header. For example,\n\n`Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}`\n\n### Request\n\nFor example, you can list your sheets by executing the following `GET /sheets` method (swap in *your* access token).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET -H \"Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}\" \\\n\"https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets\"\n```\n\n### Response\n\nThe JSON response should look something like this (after formatting):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pageNumber\": 1,\n  \"pageSize\": 100,\n  \"totalPages\": 1,\n  \"totalCount\": 2,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 6141831453927300,\n      \"name\": \"My first sheet\",\n      \"accessLevel\": \"ADMIN\",\n      \"permalink\": \"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2023-09-25T17:38:02Z\",\n      \"modifiedAt\": \"2023-09-25T17:38:09Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 6141831453927300,\n      \"name\": \"Sheet shared to me\",\n      \"accessLevel\": \"VIEWER\",\n      \"permalink\": \"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2017-06-27T21:17:15Z\",\n      \"modifiedAt\": \"2023-04-19T17:16:05Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nCongratulations on executing your first Smartsheet API request!\n\n### What's next?\n\n- [API Basics](/#section/API-Basics) (recommended) explains the fundamentals of using the Smartsheet API\n- [Resources](/#section/RESOURCES): skip ahead to learn about resource endpoints and objects, including [Folders](/#tag/foldersDescription), [Sheets](/#tag/sheetsDescription), [Cells](/#tag/cellsDescription), and more\n- [Smartsheet SDKs and samples](/#section/sdks-and-samples), for streamlined interfaces in C#, Java, Node.js, and Python \n\n# API Basics\n\n## Authentication and Access Tokens\n\nThe API authenticates using access tokens (API keys). An access token must accompany every request. \n\n### Generate an Access Token\n\nYou can [generate access tokens](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2482389-generate-API-key) in the Smartsheet UI.\n\n1. Go to the Smartsheet UI.\n1. Click the **Account** button in the lower-left corner of the Smartsheet screen, and then click **Personal Settings**.\n2. Click the **API Access** tab.\n3. Click the **Generate new access token** button to obtain an access token.\n\n> IMPORTANT: Store your access token in a secure location. See [Access Token Best Practices](/#section/Security/Access-Token-Best-Practices).\n\n### Use Access Tokens in Requests\n\nPass in your access token as the `Bearer` value in your request's authorization header. For example,\n\n`Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}`\n\nThe example request below, gets a listing of sheets belonging to the user associated with the access token. You can try the command by swapping in your own access token.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET -H \"Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}\" \\\n\"https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets\"\n````\n\n> IMPORTANT: Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done over HTTPS.\n\nAs an alternative to using manually generated access tokens, you can authenticate consenting users on the fly via [OAuth with Smartsheet](/#section/Security/Application-Authentication-Approaches).\n\nSee the [Security](/#section/Security) section for details and security best practices.\n\n## Dates and Times\n\nThe Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) and formatted for [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. If you specify a date and time, you should also send that information in ISO-8601 format. If a date/time needs to be displayed to an end-user in their local time zone, you must do the conversion using the user's time zone, which you can obtain by [getting the current user](/#tag/users/operation/get-current-user).\n\nYou can optionally choose to receive and send dates/times in numeric format, as milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970, in UTC), using the query string parameter numericDates with a value of true. This query parameter works for any API request.\n\nNOTE: Some SDK methods use language-specific Date objects, which require different date formats.\n\n## Filtering\n\nYou cannot create or update filters using the API; however, you can query which rows have been filtered out and you can get filter definitions.\n\nFor details, see [Filters object](/tag/sheetsObjects#section/Filters-Object).\n\n## Formatting\n\nTo set or read formatting programmatically, Smartsheet uses a compact format string, **cell.format**, which looks something like this: `\",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"`. The position and sample values in this string are explained in the following format descriptor table:\n\n**Format Descriptor Table**\n\n**Position** | **Lookup Property** | **Example Value** | **Format String**\n-----|-----|-----|-----|\n0 | **fontFamily** | 0 = Arial, default | `\"0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"`\n1 | **fontSize** | 0 = 10 pt, default | `\",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"`\n2 | **bold** | 1 = on | `\",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"`\n3 | **italic** | 1 = on | `\",,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"`\n4 | **underline** | 1 = on | `\",,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,\"`\n5 | **strikethrough** | 1 = on | `\",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,\"`\n6 | **horizontalAlign** | 2 = center | `\",,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,\"`\n7 | **verticalAlign** | 2 = middle | `\",,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,\"`\n8 | **color** (text) | 4 = #FEEEF0 | `\",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,\"`\n9 | **color** (background) | 8 = #E6F5FE | `\",,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,\"`\n10 | **color** (taskbar) | 9 = #F3E5FA | `\",,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,\"`\n11 | **currency** | 13 = USD | `\",,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,,\"`\n12 | **decimalCount** | 3 = three decimal places | `\",,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,\"`\n13 | **thousandsSeparator** | 1 = on | `\",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,\"`\n14 | **numberFormat** | 2 = currency | `\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,\"`\n15 | **textWrap** | 1 = on | `\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,\"`\n16 | **dateFormat** | 1 = mmmm d yyyy (December 8, 1997) | `\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1\"`\n\nNOTES:\n* Formats that have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string. For example, a cell that has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats applied to it, has a format descriptor of <code>\",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"</code>.\n* Use <code>GET /serverinfo</code> to return the [FormatTables](/tag/commonObjects#section/FormatTables-Object) object, which tells you both the default settings and what formatting options are available.\n\n**Applying Formatting**\n\nUse the \"include=format\" query-string parameter on API operations that return detailed objects, such as `GET /sheets/{sheetId}` or `GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`. If there is formatting other than default settings, the return includes a **format** property. If an object has conditional formatting, the **format** property returned will have a **conditionalFormat** value.\n\nSetting the format of a row object or column object through the API simply sets the baseline format for new or blank cells in that row or column.  It does not affect cells that already have a value.\n\nIf you want to change the formatting of cells that already have content, for instance you want to make a row bold, then you have to set the format for each cell individually.\n\n## Formulas \n\nFormulas are processed per cell in the UI. Use the [Cell object](/tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object) to manipulate formulas via the API.\n\nFor requests, use [Update Rows](/tag/rows#operation/update-rows) to add or update the formula in a cell.\n\nFor response payloads, formulas (when present) are returned whenever the Cell object is returned, so for example, GET /sheets/(id) returns the Cell object for each cell and that object contains a **formula** value when the cell contains a formula.\n\n## HTTP and REST\n\nThe REST URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions.\n\nTo get a list of sheets, use the following:\n\n`GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets`\n\nThis returns a list of Sheet objects, where each sheet has an **id** attribute.\n\nTo get details on the sheet with **id 123456**, use the following:\n\n`GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456`\n\nThis Id pattern is repeated throughout the API. Columns, rows, cells, comments, attachments, or any other data element have a unique Id.\n\nIf you don't want to make raw HTTP calls, Smartsheet also has several Software Development Kits (SDKs) that provide a higher level interface for popular programming languages. For more information, see [SDKs and Samples](/#section/SDKs-and-Samples).\n\n## HTTP Headers\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and the response body data is returned as JSON.\n\nThe following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:\n\nHeader | Definition | Example |\n-----|-----|-----|\n**Authorization** | Required for all endpoints, except for `POST /token`. The access token. | {{vault:bearer-token}}\n**Content-Type** | Required for POST and PUT requests. Defines the structure for the response. | application/json\n**Assume-User** | Optional. Allows an admin to act on behalf of, or impersonate, the user to make API calls. The email address used to identify the user must be URI-encoded. | jane.doe%40smartsheet.com\n\n## HTTP Verbs\n\nCall the API using the following [standard HTTP methods](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html):\n\n* GET (to retrieve an object or list multiple objects in a specific category)\n* POST (to create)\n* PUT (to modify)\n* DELETE\n\n## HTTP Status Codes\n\nSmartsheet uses a combination of [HTTP status codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) and custom error codes with a descriptive message in JSON-formatted [Error objects](/tag/commonObjects#section/Error-Object) to give you a more complete picture of what has happened with your request.\n\nHTTP<br/>status code | Meaning | To Retry or Not to Retry? |\n-----|-----|-----|\n2xx | Request was successful.<br/><br/>Example: 200 Success | --\n4xx | A problem with request prevented it from executing successfully. | Never automatically retry the request.<br/><br/>If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, fix the problem and retry the request.\n5xx | The request was properly formatted, but the operation failed on Smartsheet's end. | In some scenarios, requests should be automatically retried using [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).\n\nFor example, doing a `GET` on a non-existent sheet at `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456` results in an HTTP status code of **404**, indicating the resource was not found.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"errorCode\": 1006,\n  \"message\": \"Not Found\"\n}\n```\n<br/>\n\nSome errors may contain a **detail** attribute set to an object with additional error details that may be useful in programmatically handling the error.  If so, it is noted in the specific API operation for which the error may occur.\n\nNOTE: Smartsheet has custom error codes to help you troubleshoot issues. See [Error Codes](/#section/Error-Codes).\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile Smartsheet is improving capacity frequently, there are some hard limits that might be helpful to know:\n\n* When adding or updating rows, limit your request to 500 rows at a time.\n* A sheet cannot exceed a total of 500,000 cells. To determine how close you are to the 500,000 cell limit, multiply the number of columns in your sheet by the number of rows. For example, a sheet with 20,000 rows can only have 25 or fewer columns, and a sheet with 400 columns can only have 1,250 or fewer rows.\n* Any one sheet can have up to 500,000 inbound cell links. (Smartsheet Gov has an inbound cell link limit of 100,000.)\n* No cell can contain more than 4,000 characters.\n* When using a GET /reports/{reportId} call with paging, the default is 100 rows. If you need larger sets of data from your report, this operation can return a maximum of 10,000 rows per request.\n* Reports are limited to 50,000 rows.\n* When sharing emails, you can send 1000 per API call.\n\nThe following features aren't yet supported for sheets with more than 5000 rows, or more than 200 columns:\n\n* Bridge by Smartsheet\n* Quip connector\n* Tableau connector\n* PowerBI connector\n* Zapier connector\n* Google Docs Merge connector\n* Google Forms sync connector\n* LiveData connector\n* Calendar App\n\n## Looping\n\nLooping is an expected action when working with the Smartsheet API. But when do you run the For Loop? Do you loop through multiple endpoint calls or is there a more efficient way?\n\nFor instance, if you're looking for multiple values on a given sheet, fetch the entire sheet. Do the searching on the return data in one single For Loop rather than calling the search endpoint multiple times with different values.\n\n## Multi-contact or Multi-picklist: Working with Complex Objects\n\nNew column types, such as MULTI_CONTACT_LIST and MULTI_PICKLIST, offer more complex ways to work with columns. Smartsheet has provided a backwards compatible way for these payloads to work with your existing integrations while also giving you a way to query for their content.\n\nWith either column type, there are two ways of receiving the response:\n\n* If you do nothing to your code, column types will display as TEXT_NUMBER\n* If you use the level query parameter as detailed below, column types will display as MULTI_CONTACT_LIST or MULTI_PICKLIST and return a complex object (aka a non-primitive type)\n\nSmartsheet uses two indicators to help you discover changes in the return data for your API calls:\n\n* level: a query parameter that is incremented when a new feature or column type is added\n* version: each element in the Columns array is set to one of the following values:\n\nText | Multi-contact | Multi-picklist\n-----|-----|-----|\n0 | 1 | 2\n\nYou must use the level query parameter, for example **level=2**, to return a complex object with the new column type. Without the query parameter, the response will be backwards-compatible, that is a string. The <b>include=objectValue</b> query parameter is necessary to see the return as a complex value, such as actual email addresses rather than display names.\n\nUse the highest possible level for each endpoint, as in the following table:\n\nEndpoint category | Level\n-----|-----|\nDashboards | 4\nReports | 3\nSheets | 2\n\n## Object Details vs List Summaries\n\nMany of the List All commands, for example, `GET /sheets`, return only an abbreviated object for each object returned. For full details, read a single item, such as `GET /sheets/{sheetId}`. In many cases, you can refine the exact object properties to be returned by using **include** and **exclude** query parameters.\n\nThe JSON representation of the objects returned from the List All REST endpoints will only include a subset of the properties documented here. However, the objects returned from the Java and C# SDKs will represent the omitted properties with NULLs.\n\n## Query Strings\n\nMany API calls can be modified by including one or more of these common query strings:\n\nQuery Parameter | Type | Description | More Info |\n-----|-----|-----|-----|\n**accessApiLevel** | Number | Allows COMMENTER access for inputs and return values. For backwards-compatibility, VIEWER is the default. For example, to see whether a user has COMMENTER access for a sheet, use accessApiLevel=1. |\n**allowPartialSuccess** | Boolean | If **true**, allows bulk operations to process even if one or more operations are invalid for some reason, for example, **allowPartialSuccess=true**. | [Bulk Operations](/#section/Work-at-Scale/Bulk-Operations)\n**include** or **exclude** | String | When applicable for a specific object, various **include** or **exclude** parameters are available, for example, **include=format**. | Object reference or [Formatting](/#section/API-Basics/Formatting)\n**includeAll** | Boolean | If **true**, includes all results, for example, **includeAll=true**. | [Paging](/#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging)\n**level** | Number | Use for complex objects. | [Working with Complex Objects](/#section/API-Basics/Multi-contact-or-Multi-picklist:-Working-with-Complex-Objects)\n**numericDates** | Boolean | If **true**, allows you to input or receive dates in numeric format, for example, **numericDates=true**. | [Dates and Times](/#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times)\n**page** | String | Specifies which page to return, for example, **page=4**. | [Paging](/#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging)\n**pageSize** | Number | Specifies the maximum number of items to return per page, for example, **pageSize=25**. | [Paging](/#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging)\n\nNOTE: Query strings are case sensitive. If you do not see the expected response, confirm that your query is formatted correctly.\n\n## Sheets/Columns/Rows/Cells\n\nSheets have a core hierarchy of Sheet > Column > Row > Cell. The strict hierarchy tells you how to associate the objectId with the object. For example, your return might include a Sheet object with many Row objects. Each object has an objectId. The strict hierarchy helps you map the objectId to the sheet or specific row.\n\nCells are a little different. You identify a cell by its location in the grid, so you need both a column Id and a row Id to pinpoint a specific cell. The following table defines these terms and points you to places in this documentation where you can find more information:\n\nUI Element | Description | More Info\n-----|-----|-----|\nsheet | A sheet can exist in a user's [Home](/#tag/homeDescription) folder, in a [folder](/#tag/foldersDescription), or in a [workspace](/#tag/workspacesDescription/). It is comprised of columns, rows, and cells, and may optionally contain attachments or discussions. | [Sheet object](/tag/sheetsObjects#section/Sheet-Object)\ncolumn | A Column object *defines* the type of the column, but does not actually contain cells. The Column Id identifies the cells in a row. | [Column object](/#tag/columnsObjects#section/Column-Object), [Column types](/#tag/columnsRelated#section/Column-Types)\nrow | A row is a component of a sheet or report. Each row is composed of a collection of cells, and may optionally contain attachments or discussions. | [Row object](/tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object)\ncell | A cell is a location within a sheet that may contain a value. A collection of cells comprises each row in a sheet. | [Cell object](/tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object), [Cell reference](/tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference)\n\n## Sheet Responses\n\nMany Smartsheet API operations handle sheets, rows, columns, and cells. Each is identified by an Id and it is important to understand the relationship between these objects. Typically you loop through the columns to determine the Id of the columns you are interested in. Then you loop through the rows and contained cells to find actual values. The annotated sample response below illustrates these concepts by calling a very simple sheet called \"Employee Roster\".\n\n<img src=\"/images/Employee_roster.png\" alt=\"Basic sheet with 2 rows and 2 columns\" />\n\nBefore you begin, you should already have an access token, which you used in the exercise above. Use the same access token for this walkthrough.\n\n**Step 1:** The first thing you must have is a sheetId. To find a sheetId through the UI, with the sheet open, click \"Sheet Actions\" in the left toolbar and select \"Properties\". **NOTE:** use [List Sheets](/tag/sheets#operation/list-sheets) if you want to do this programmatically.\n\n<img src=\"/images/sheet-properties.png\" alt=\"Image of the Sheet Properties window\" />\n\n**Step 2:** Copy the sheetId into the API call, `GET /sheets`, as below:\n\n`curl -X GET -H \"Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}\" \"https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/6141831453927300\"`\n\n**Step 3:** The sample request and response are displayed below. **NOTE:** while JSON doesn't have a comment feature, this sample uses comments to help you identify the objects in the response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 6141831453927300,    // Sheet Id\n  \"name\": \"My first sheet\",\n  \"columns\": [{              // Each Column object associates column Id\n                             // to title and defines the\n                             // column details\n\n        \"id\": 2517104256673668,   // Column Id\n        \"index\": 0,\n        \"title\": \"Name\",\n        \"type\": \"TEXT_NUMBER\",\n        \"primary\": true,\n        \"width\": 150\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": 7020703884044164,   // Next column Id\n        \"index\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"EmployeeId\",\n        \"type\": \"TEXT_NUMBER\",\n        \"width\": 150\n      }\n  ],\n  \"rows\": [{                       // A Row object\n         \"id\": 564480076736388,    // Row Id\n         \"rowNumber\": 1,\n         \"expanded\": true,\n         \"createdAt\": \"2017-05-12T16:52:38Z\",\n         \"modifiedAt\": \"2017-05-22T20:40:14Z\",\n         \"cells\": [{  // Each row contains an array of cells,\n                      // which have the actual content\n\n                     \"columnId\": 2517104256673668,\n                     // The column Id can be interpreted by\n                     // looking at the array of column\n                     // definitions above. That tells you\n                     // this is the \"Name\" column\n\n                     \"value\": \"John Doe\",\n                     \"displayValue\": \"John Doe\"\n                   },\n                   {\n                     \"columnId\": 7020703884044164,\n                     \"value\": 12345,            // Actual cell value\n                     \"displayValue\": \"12,345\"\n                     // How the cell value is displayed in the UI\n                   }\n         ]},\n       {\n         \"id\": 5068079704106884,\n         \"rowNumber\": 2,\n         \"siblingId\": 564480076736388,\n         \"expanded\": true,\n         \"createdAt\": \"2017-05-12T16:52:38Z\",\n         \"modifiedAt\": \"2017-05-22T20:40:14Z\",\n         \"cells\": [{\n                     \"columnId\": 2517104256673668,\n                     \"value\": \"Jane Roe\",\n                     \"displayValue\": \"Jane Roe\"\n                   },\n                   {\n                     \"columnId\": 7020703884044164,\n                     \"value\": 67890,\n                     \"displayValue\": \"67890\"\n                   }\n         ]\n       }\n  ]\n}\n```\n<br/>\n\nThis core hierarchy of Sheet > Column > Row > Cell is essential to working with the Smartsheet API. As your user's sheets grow in complexity, the responses do too. This walkthrough has given you some navigational aid in finding the right value to plug into your API calls. Use the API Reference and the example language tabs to learn more.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nShould you encounter issues with the Smartsheet API while building an integration using a particular programming language, for example C#, Java, Node.js, Python, or Ruby, keep the following troubleshooting techniques in mind.\n\nTry executing the same API Request using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request / Response.\n\n* If you receive a similar error when you execute the Request using cURL or Postman, this suggests an issue with the Request format or contents. Once you have the Request working in cURL or Postman, update your code accordingly.\n* If you can execute the Request successfully using cURL or Postman, but not via your code, this suggests that the Request your code is sending is somehow different than what you intend. Compare the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman with the (unsuccessful) Request that your code generates. (See step #2 below.)\n\nExamine the Request that your code is sending (including the HTTP verb, URI, headers, and Request body) and the Response that it's receiving back from Smartsheet (including the HTTP status code, headers, and response body).\n\n* If you've implemented Request / Response logging in your application, inspect the full trace of Request and Response in the log file. Compare the Request that your application is logging with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.\n* Alternatively, you may choose to use a tool like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or [Charles HTTP Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) to inspect the full trace of Request and Response as it goes across the wire. Compare the Request trace that your application generates with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.\n\nCheck for capitalization errors. **NOTE:** URL endpoints are all lower case, while object properties and query parameters are camelCase.\n\n## User Impersonation\n\nAllows an admin to act on behalf of, or impersonate, the user to make API calls. You might do this to troubleshoot a user problem or cover for vacations and sick time. As with cURL, the email address used to identify the user must be URI-encoded.\n\nAn admin cannot impersonate another admin.\n\nNOTE: You must manually generate a token to assume user.\n\n**cURL example**\n```json\ncurl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets \\\n-H \"Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}\" \\\n-H \"Assume-User: jane.doe%40smartsheet.com\" \\\n```\n\n**C# example**\n```csharp\nSmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder()\n  .SetAccessToken(accessToken)\n  .SetAssumedUser(\"jane.doe@smartsheet.com\")\n  .Build();\n```\n\n**Java example**\n```java\nsmartsheet.setAssumedUser(\"jane.doe@smartsheet.com\");\n```\n\n**Node.js example**\n```javascript\n// Set options\nvar options = {\n  assumeUser: \"jane.doe@smartsheet.com\"\n  };\n\n// List Sheets\nsmartsheet.sheets.listSheets(options)\n  .then(function(sheetList) {\n    console.log(sheetList);\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) {\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n```\n\n**Python example**\n```python\nsmartsheet_client.assume_user(\"jane.doe@smartsheet.com\")\n```\n\n**Ruby example**\n```ruby\nsmartsheet.sheets.list(\n  header_override: {:'Assume-User' => CGI::escape('jane.doe@smartsheet.com')}\n)\n```\n\n## Versioning and Changes\n\nSmartsheet will add new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. Make sure that your code can handle new JSON properties gracefully. Also, make sure your code does not depend on the order in which JSON objects are returned, unless it is explicitly stated in this documentation.\n\nWhen there is new functionality that is not compatible with existing code, say in the case of a new concept, Smartsheet increments the level to indicate the new feature can be ignored until you are ready to implement the code to work with the new level.\n\nSee also: [Multi-contact or Multi-picklist: Working with Complex Objects](/#section/API-Basics/Multi-contact-or-Multi-picklist:-Working-with-Complex-Objects)\n\n# Error Codes\n\nFor an explanation of the logic behind Smartsheet error codes and error handling, see the [HTTP and REST](/#section/API-Basics/HTTP-and-REST) portion of the Introduction.\n\n## 400-Level Error Codes\n\n400-level error codes generally indicate that there is something you should fix or add to your request before you try the request again.\n\nHTTP status code | Smartsheet errorCode | Smartsheet message\n-----|-----|-----|\n401 | 1001 | An Access Token is required.\n401 | 1002 | Your Access Token is invalid.\n401 | 1003 | Your Access Token has expired.\n403 | 1004 | You are not authorized to perform this action.\n401 | 1005 | Single Sign-On is required for this account.\n404 | 1006 | Not Found.\n404 | 1007 | Version not supported.\n400 | 1008 | Unable to parse request.

If you are building an app, this documentation will walk you through the steps you need to authenticate your users. The Smartsheet [SDKs](/#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code) contain APIs for OAuth 2.0.\n\n*NOTE:* You will need a Tenant ID for users of apps like AWS AppFabric. You can find your Tenant ID in Admin Center under *Security & Controls*. There is a *Smartsheet Tenant ID* pane.\n      \n## First Steps\n\nBefore you can start using OAuth 2.0 with your app, Smartsheet needs the following information:\n\n 1. You must register (https://developers.smartsheet.com/register) with Smartsheet\nto get a developer account*. The developer account gives you access to \"Developer Tools,\" where you manage your app.\n 2. In \"Developer Tools,\" complete any required fields in your developer profile.\n 3. In \"Developer Tools,\" register your app so Smartsheet can assign it a client\nID and a client secret.\n 4. Review the list of access scopes. Choose which ones your app needs to access\na user's Smartsheet data. The user must consent to that access.\nAfter you've worked through these steps, you'll be ready to implement the [OAuth Flow](/#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/OAuth-Flow).\n\n*NOTE:* Your use of the Smartsheet APIs and SDKs are governed by the [Developer Agreement](https://www.smartsheet.com/legal/developer-program-agreement).\n\n*A developer account is a service account you should use when developing an integration. It counts as an additional account against your plan. A best practice is to keep this account separate from your user account.\n\n## Open Developer Tools\n\n1. Log in to Smartsheet with your developer account.\n2. Click the \"Account\" button in the lower-left corner of your Smartsheet screen, and then click \"Developer Tools\".\n3. Do one of the following:\n  * If you need to register an app, click \"Create New App\".\n  * If you need to manage an app, click \"view/edit\" for the app.\n\n## Register Your App Using Developer Tools\n\n1. Log in to Smartsheet with your developer account.\n2. Click the \"Account\" button in the upper-right corner of your Smartsheet screen, and then click \"Developer Tools\".\n3. In the \"Create New App\" form, provide the following information:\n  * Name: the name the user sees to identify your app\n  * Description: a brief description intended for the user\n  * URL: the URL to launch your app, or the landing page if not a web app\n  * Contact/support: support information for the user\n  * Redirect URL: also known as a callback URL. The URL within your application\nthat will receive the OAuth 2.0 credentials\nAfter you click \"Save\", Smartsheet assigns a client Id and secret to your app. Make a note of these Ids for the next steps; however, you can always look them up again in \"Developer Tools\".\n\n## OAuth Flow\n\nYour app must implement a 3-legged OAuth flow to retrieve an access token it can use to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user.\nThe following diagram has an overview of the OAuth flow:\n\n<img src=\"/images/OAuth_flow2.png\" alt=\"Simplified graphic showing what data is passed back and forth during OAuth flow\">\n\nNOTE: App registration and OAuth flow require HTTPS.\n\n## Access Scopes\n\nTo access a user's Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask the user for permission. You do this by using access scopes, which enable your app to communicate to the user what type of operations it is performing.\nAccess scopes do not override existing [access-level restrictions](/#section/Security/Resource-Access-Levels).\nFor example, having the access scope of **WRITE_SHEETS** does not allow your app to update a sheet on which the user has **VIEWER** access level.\n\nThe access scopes are as follows:\n\nAccess Scope | Description\n-----|-----|\nADMIN_SHEETS | Modify sheet structure, including column definition, publish state, etc.\nADMIN_SIGHTS | Modify Sights/dashboards structure.\nADMIN_USERS | Add and remove users from your Smartsheet organization account; create groups and manage membership.\nADMIN_WEBHOOKS | Create, delete, and update webhooks; get all webhooks; reset shared secret.\nADMIN_WORKSPACES | Create and manage workspaces and folders, including sharing.\nCREATE_SHEETS | Create new sheets.\nCREATE_SIGHTS | Create new Sights/dashboards.\nDELETE_SHEETS | Delete sheets.\nDELETE_SIGHTS | Delete Sights/dashboards.\nREAD_CONTACTS | Retrieve contacts.\nREAD_EVENTS | Retrieve events.\nREAD_SHEETS | Read all sheet data, including attachments, discussions, and cell data.\nREAD_SIGHTS | Read all Sights/dashboards data.\nREAD_USERS | Retrieve users and groups for your Smartsheet organization account.\nSHARE_SHEETS | Share sheets, including sending sheets as attachments.\nSHARE_SIGHTS | Share Sights/dashboards.\nWRITE_SHEETS | Insert and modify sheet data, including attachments, discussions, and cell data.\n\nNOTE: <b>Additional Info:</b><ul><li>When you request an authorization code, you specify all of the access scopes you need for your app. Smartsheet encodes those permissions into the auth code and subsequent access token.</li><li>Your app must request at least one access scope, but should only request the scopes necessary.</li><li>Once your app attains a valid access token, it can execute a [Get Current User](/tag/users#operation/get-current-user) operation, regardless of which access scopes were requested.</li></ul>\n\n## Request an Authorization Code\n\n`GET https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize`\n\n`POST https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize`\n\nInitiates the process to get authorization from the user.\nSmartsheet will redirect this URL to display your app's consent page with an explanation of the data the app will need access to. This consent page is autogenerated by Smartsheet based on a combination of the information you registered for your app and the parameters you send with the request.\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**client_id** | Required. The client Id you obtained when you registered your app.\n**response_type** | Required. Indicates whether the endpoint returns an authorization code. Must be set to \"code\".\n**scope** | Required. Space-delimited list of [access scopes](/#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes) to which you are asking the user to grant access. **NOTE:** No access scopes are necessary if you simply need to validate that the user has a Smartsheet account.\n**state** | Optional. An arbitrary string of your choosing that is returned to your app; a successful roundtrip of this string helps ensure that your app initiated the request.\n\nYou can view code examples by clicking the corresponding tab in the rightmost pane. The cURL example shows a `GET`.\n\nA correctly formatted Auth URL request looks like this: `https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=dheu3dmkd32fhxme&scope=READ_SHEETS%20WRITE_SHEETS&state=MY_STATE`\n\nNOTE: If the user has not yet logged into Smartsheet, the redirect will first take them to a login page, and then display the consent page.\n\nAt this point, the user can authorize your app to access their Smartsheet account, as in the following example:\n\n<img src=\"/images/developer_tools3.png\" alt=\"Dialog box to allow or deny scopes\">\n\nAfter the user clicks \"Allow\" or \"Deny\", you'll receive a response from Smartsheet outlined in the next sections.\n\n## If the User Clicks Allow\n\nIf the user clicks \"Allow\", Smartsheet redirects the user to the callback URL with the following parameters:\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**code** | Authorization code required to obtain access token, such as 'sample6p9qisx6a'.\n**expires_in** | Number of milliseconds code is valid once issued; this is currently 599135 milliseconds, or approx. 10 minutes--you must obtain an access token within that time.\n**state** | The same value for **state** that you sent when you requested the authorization code.\n\nAt this point, you should verify the **state** value matches what you sent to the user when you requested the authorization code. This helps you determine that the response came from the user and not a malicious script. If the values do not match, you should reject the response.\n\nFor other error conditions, see the list of [OAuth Error Types](/#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/OAuth-Error-Types).\n\n## If the User Clicks Deny\n\nIf the user clicks \"Deny\", Smartsheet redirects the user to the callback URL with the following parameters:\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**error** | \"access_denied\".\n**state** | The same value for **state** that you sent when you requested the authorization code.\n\n## Get or Refresh an Access Token\n\nOnce you’ve successfully obtained an authorization code, the next step is to exchange the code for an access token. (Remember, the authorization code expires after 599135 milliseconds.)\n\nAccess tokens expire after 604799 seconds, which is approx 7 days. Use the refresh token to obtain a new access token and a new refresh token. Once you obtain the new tokens, you must use them in place of the old ones, which are no longer valid.\n\nTo get or refresh an access token, see [Refresh Access Token](/tag/token#operation/tokens-getOrRefresh).\n\n## OAuth Error Types\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**invalid_client** | The client information is invalid. Ensure your client id is correct.\n**invalid_grant** | The authorization code or refresh token is invalid or expired or the hash value does not match the app secret and/or code.\n**invalid_request** | The request parameters are invalid or missing.\n**invalid_scope** | One or more of the requested access scopes is invalid. Please check the list of [access scopes](/#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes).\n**unsupported_grant_type** | **grant_type** must equal **authorization_code** or **refresh_token**.\n**unsupported_response_type** | **response_type** must be set to **code**.\n\n# SDKs and Samples\n\nSmartsheet software development kits (SDKs) and sample applications help you develop with C#, Java, Node.js, and Python.\n\nThe SDKs are streamlined interfaces for using Smartsheet in several languages. The sample applications demonstrate using the SDKs to access Smartsheet.\n\nLanguage | SDK | Sample application\n-----|-----|-----|\nC# | [smartsheet-csharp-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-csharp-sdk) | [csharp-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/csharp-read-write-sheet)\nJava | [smartsheet-java-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-java-sdk) | [java-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/java-read-write-sheet)\nNode.js | [smartsheet-javascript-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-javascript-sdk) | [node-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/node-read-write-sheet)\nPython | [smartsheet-python-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-python-sdk) | [python-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/python-read-write-sheet)\nRuby* | [smartsheet-ruby-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk) | [ruby-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/ruby-read-write-sheet)\n\n*The Ruby SDK is no longer maintained.\n\nSKD benefits:\n* Retry with backoff to automatically recover from network errors or rate limiting\n* Request & response logging\n* Native object models for request and responses (Java and C# only)\n\nEach SDK readme file demonstrates SDK installation and using the SDK. \n\nYou can download the sample apps and run them with SDKs. The samples can be a great starting points for your own applications.\n\n# Security\n\nThe following provides some best practices to consider when working with the Smartsheet API and any access tokens (API keys), or other sensitive information.\n\n## Application Authentication Approaches\n\nWhen choosing an authentication method, it is important to consider your integration scenario. Is the integration machine-to-machine without user interaction, or do you want user consent and interaction?\n\n- **If your scenario involes user consent and interaction,** it's typically best to use OAuth with Smartsheet. Note that the Smartsheet implementation of OAuth 2.0 is a 3-legged process, which requires human intervention. See [OAuth Walkthrough](/#section/OAuth-Walkthrough) for details.\n\n- **If your scnenario is strictly machine-to-machine,** execute raw token requests over HTTPS. It's a straightforward, secure way to authenticate. See [Authentication and Access Tokens](/#section/API-Basics/Authentication-and-Access-Tokens) for details.\n\nEach scenario requires an HTTP authorization header containing an access token.\n\n> NOTE: In applications and for routine requests, it is best to use a shared account, such as ticket-processor@example.com, rather than your individual work account.\n\n> WARNING: If an unauthorized user gets a copy of this token, they will be able to access all Smartsheet data that you have access to, both to read and modify on your behalf. You should keep your tokens secure and do not share them with anyone. \n\n## Access Token Best Practices\n\nNever commit access tokens (API keys) to accessible version control systems like GitHub or BitBucket. Instead, use one of the following recommended storage options.\n\n### Recommended Storage Options\n\n* Use an app configuration tool suitable for deploying secrets to your app, or\n* Use a config file outside of source control, or\n* Use environment variables set outside of source control.\n\nIf you have mistakenly deployed API keys to a publicly accessible location such as GitHub, then you should immediately revoke those API keys, revise your application to use a preferred method of key deployment, and then generate new keys.\n\n### Storing in a database\n\nIf you need to store API keys in a database, consider the following protections:\n\n* Restrict access so API keys are only readable by the owner of the object\n* Restrict read privileges to the database table\n* Make sure your database or the disk the database is on is set to encrypt data at rest\n\n> NOTE: When using any Smartsheet SDK, you can use the environment variable of `SMARTSHEET_ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the access token is null on input to the client builder, the SDK will automatically pick up the value of that environment variable.\n\n## Revoking and Regenerating Tokens\n\nIf you've committed code to a repository before implementing these security best practices, here are some steps to resecure your API keys.\n\n**For requests with raw tokens:**\n\n1. [Revoke the token](/tag/token#operation/tokens-delete)\n2. Create a [new token](/#section/API-Basics/Authentication-and-Access-Tokens)\n\n**For OAuth with Smartsheet:** Work through the [OAuth Walkthrough](/#section/OAuth-Walkthrough) to regenerate client secrets, auth codes, and tokens.\n\n## Resource Access Levels\n\nSheet, template, and workspace objects have an `accessLevel` attribute that describes the current user's access level to that object.\nThis corresponds directly to the sharing and access controls of Smartsheet that are available through the Smartsheet UI.\n\nThe `accessLevel` attribute has one of the following values:\n\nValue (`string`) | Description |\n-----|-----|\n`ADMIN` | The user can edit and share the resource, and can alter the structure of the resource as well.\n`COMMENTER` | The same as `VIEWER`, but with the ability to leave comments and add attachments.\n`EDITOR` | The user can edit the resource, but cannot alter the structure of, delete, or share the resource.\n`EDITOR_SHARE` | The same as `EDITOR`, but with the ability to share the resource to other users.\n`OWNER` | The user has complete control over the resource.\n`VIEWER` | The user has read-only access to the resource.\n\n> NOTE: Smartsheet also uses [access scopes](/#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes). *Access levels* describe the actual permissions a specific user has for a specific sheet or other resource. *Access scopes* describe the general categories of access requested by a third-party app.\n\n# Smartsheet Gov\n\nSmartsheet Gov has \"FedRAMP Authorized\" status as part of Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). As an API developer working on a Smartsheet Gov account, you should be aware of the following differences from the standard API:\n\n* The base URL for each API call is smartsheetgov.com instead of smartsheet.com. This documentation uses smartsheet.com in *all* examples.\n* Smartsheetgov.com uses a separate token from Smartsheet.com.\n* Smartsheetgov.com has a restriction on attachment types. Only the following attachment types are allowed: BOX_COM, FILE, GOOGLE_DRIVE, LINK, or ONEDRIVE.\n\nIf you use a Smartsheet SDK, you need to modify the standard config file to point to smartsheetgov.com. There are instructions specific to each SDK on how to modify the config file at the following locations:\n\n* [C# SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-csharp-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheetgovcom-accounts)\n* [Java SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-java-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheetgovcom-accounts)\n* [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk#working-with-smartsheetgovcom-accounts)\n* [Python SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-python-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheetgovcom-accounts)\n* [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk#basic-configuration)\n\n# Smartsheet Regions Europe\n\nSmartsheet Regions Europe is a separate data island. As an API developer working on a Smartsheet Regions Europe account, you should be aware of the following differences from the standard API:\n\n* The base URL for each API call is smartsheet.eu instead of smartsheet.com. This documentation uses smartsheet.com in *all* examples.\n* Smartsheet Regions Europe aka Smartsheet EU uses a separate token from Smartsheet.com.\n\nIf you use a Smartsheet SDK, you need to modify the standard config file to point to smartsheet.eu. There are instructions specific to each SDK on how to modify the config file at the following locations:\n\n* [C# SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-csharp-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheet-regions-europe-accounts)\n* [Java SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-java-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheet-regions-europe-accounts)\n* [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk#working-with-smartsheet-regions-europe-accounts)\n* [Python SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-python-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheet-regions-europe-accounts)\n* [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk#basic-configuration)\n\n# Updating Code \n\n## Migrate from GET /home/folders \n\nThe `GET /home/folders` method is deprecated and will be removed. The method lists your **Sheets** folder's subfolders. The Sheets folder is being replaced by Workspaces.\n\n> NOTE: You can list your **Sheets** folder's subfolders in the UI. First, select the **Browse** icon in the left navigation bar to expand the Browse panel. In the panel, select the **Sheets** folder. The **Sheets** subfolders appear.\n\n### Steps\n\nHere are steps for migrating from the `GET /home/folders` method to using Workspaces.\n\n1. Move any items and folders from your **Sheets** folder to Workspaces.\n\n1. Use the following methods to fetch items from Workspaces:\n\n    - [`GET /workspaces`](/tag/workspaces#operation/list-workspaces) lists your\nWorkspaces.\n    - [`GET/workspaces/{workspaceId}`](/tag/workspaces#operation/get-workspace)\nfetches the Workspace's children.\n    - [`GET /folders/{folderId}`](/tag/folders#operation/get-folder) fetches the\nfolder's children.\n# Work at Scale\n\n## Bulk Operations\n\nThe Smartsheet API supports a number of bulk operations that can operate on multiple objects.  Unlike single-object operations, bulk operations allow you to create, update, or delete\nmultiple objects in a single request. For example, if you want to update 10 rows within a sheet, do so using a single [Update Rows](/tag/rows#operation/update-rows) request, rather than executing 10 separate requests - one for each row.\n\n**Optional Bulk Operations**\n\nSeveral endpoints support optional bulk `POST` operations which exist alongside the standard single-object `POST`.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either a single object or an array of objects.\nDepending on what was passed in, the [Result object](/tag/commonObjects/#section/Result-Object) returned contains either a single object or an array.  An example optional bulk operation is [POST /favorites](/tag/favorites#operation/add-favorite): you can\npass in a single [Favorite object](/tag/favoritesObjects#section/Favorite-Object) to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations are\nnoted as such in the API reference documentation.\n\nNOTE: Most `POST` operations fail when attempting to create a single object which already exists (for example, favorites, shares, group members).  However, for the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints do *not*\nreturn an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items are simply ignored, and the [Result object](/tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object) returned omits them.\n\n**Partial Success**\n\nIn general, the default behavior for bulk operations is to fail outright if any of the objects in the request are invalid for some reason.  If successful, Smartsheet creates/updates/deletes all objects in the request;\nif not, no objects are changed.\n\nHowever, there are some operations that support partial success, which means the operation still succeeds even if one or more of the objects in the request fails for some reason (for example, an object is invalid). Here is another example: if you want to update more than one row, you send more than one row object in your request. If a row object is invalid, that row update will fail, but the other row updates will succeed.  Partial success is\n*not* the default mode for an operation and you must explicitly enable it by using a query string parameter.  This is noted in the documentation for operations that support partial success.\n\nWhen partial success is enabled, and one or more of the objects in the request fail to be added/updated/deleted, a standard [Result object](/tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object) is returned, but with a **message** of <b>'PARTIAL_SUCCESS'</b> (instead of <b>'SUCCESS'</b>), and a **resultCode** of **3**. Additionally, the object contains a **failedItems** attribute -- an array of [BulkItemFailure objects](/tag/commonObjects#section/BulkItemFailure-Object) that contains an item for each object in the request that failed to be added/updated/deleted.\n\n## Paging\n\nThe Smartsheet API contains a number of index endpoints (typically denoted in the documentation with titles beginning with \"Get All\" or \"List\") which return arrays of objects.\nExamples include `GET` [/users](/tag/users#operation/list-users), [/sheets](/tag/sheets#operation/list-sheets), [/sheets/{sheetId}/columns](/tag/columns#operation/columns-listOnSheet), and many others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning\nyou can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially large result sets in smaller chunks.\n\n**Paging Query String Parameters**\n\nIndex endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string parameters:\n\nValue | Type | Description |\n------|------|-------------|\n**includeAll**  | Boolean | If true, include all results, that is, do not paginate.  Mutually exclusive with **page** and **pageSize** (they are ignored if **includeAll=true** is specified).\n**page**\t\t| number  | Which page to return.  Defaults to **1** if not specified.  If you specify a value greater than the total number of pages, the last page of results is returned.\n**pageSize** \t| number  | The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to **100**.\n\nNOTE: Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you want all results at once, you must specify the <b>includeAll=true</b> query string parameter.\n\n**Paged Responses**\n\nIndex endpoints all return paged responses via an IndexResult object, which provides paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result set:\n\nValue | Type | Description |\n------|------|-------------|\n**data**\t\t| array  | An array of objects representing the current page of data in the result set.\n**pageNumber**\t| number | The current page in the full result set that the **data** array represents. NOTE: when a page number greater than **totalPages** is requested, the last page is instead returned.\n**pageSize**\t| number | The number of items in a page.  Omitted if there is no limit to page size (and hence, all results are included).  Unless otherwise specified, this defaults to **100** for most endpoints.\n**totalCount**\t| number | The total number of items in the full result set.\n**totalPages**\t| number | The total number of pages in the full result set.\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\n**Handle \"Rate limit exceeded\" Error**\n\nTo prevent abuse and undue stress on the Smartsheet servers, Smartsheet reserves the right to enforce some limits depending on the load on our systems. This reduction is sometimes called rate limiting or throttling.\nCertain operations, such as attaching a file and getting cell history, are resource intensive.\n\nThe Smartsheet API implements \"rate limiting\" to protect the system. When API calls exceed an acceptable load, an HTTP **429** status will be returned along with the following response body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"errorCode\": 4003,\n  \"message\": \"Rate limit exceeded.\"\n}\n```\n<br/>\n\nSmartsheet recommends that you design your integration to gracefully handle this rate limit error. One way of doing that would be to have your integration *sleep* for a minimum of 60 seconds when this error is encountered, and then subsequently retry the request.\n\nAlternatively, you might choose to implement [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) (an error handling strategy whereby you periodically retry a failed request with progressively longer wait times between retries, until either the request succeeds or the certain number of retry attempts is reached). Note that the SDKs implement this behavior.\n\n**Avoid Executing \"Rapid Fire\" Updates**\n\nIf the only thing your integration does is execute an [Update Rows](/tag/rows#operation/update-rows) request once every second for the same sheet, that would only amount to a total of 60 requests per minute -- well within rate limiting guidelines.\nHowever, updating the same object in such rapid succession could result in save errors that negatively impact both your integration as well as user experience within the Smartsheet app.\nTo avoid this scenario, design your integration such that API requests are never executed with rapid-fire succession against the same Smartsheet object.\nFor maximum efficiency, consider batching up changes and submitting them in a single request using a [bulk operation](/#section/Work-at-Scale/Bulk-Operations) (for example, [Update Rows](/tag/rows#operation/update-rows) or [Add Columns](/tag/columns#operation/columns-addToSheet).\n\n**Execute Requests Serially**\n\nExecuting multiple API requests in parallel to update a specific Smartsheet object results in reduced performance and often results in errors due to save collisions.\nTo avoid this scenario, design your integration such that API requests to update a specific Smartsheet object are always executed serially (that is, execute one request at time, not beginning the next request until the previous request has completed).\n\nNOTE: Attempts to perform multiple concurrent updates to a sheet may result in [error code 4004](/#section/Error-Codes/400-Level-Error-Codes).\n\n**Use the Smartsheet SDKs**\n\nThe [SDKs](/#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code) provide default backoff and retry to accommodate rate limiting responses from the API. Note that the default maximum retry duration is typically 30 seconds. You may wish to increase this if your application is making many API calls in quick succession. For specific instructions per language, see the Readme for the respective SDK.\n\n# Additional Information\n\nHere are some additional resources:\n\n* [Smartsheet Developers site](https://developers.smartsheet.com/) provides quick access to samples, SDKs, and more\n* <a href=\"https://community.smartsheet.com/categories/api-developers\" target=\"_blank\">Smartsheet API and developer community discussions</a>\n* <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/smartsheet-api\" target=\"_blank\">StackOverflow</a> `smartsheet-api` tagged questions and answers\n* <a href=\"https://10kft.github.io/10kft-api/\" target=\"_blank\">Resource Management API documentation</a>\n* <a href=\"https://developers.brandfolder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brandfolder API and SDK documentation</a>\n* <a href=\"https://help.smartsheet.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Contact us</a>\n\n*NOTE:* Your use of the Smartsheet APIs and SDKs are governed by the [Developer Agreement](https://www.smartsheet.com/legal/developer-program-agreement).\n\n**Got feedback?** Share it with us in a <a href=\"https://community.smartsheet.com/categories/api-developers\" target=\"_blank\">Smartsheet Community discussion</a>.\n\n# Changelog\n\nHere is the log of changes to the API.\n\n<!-- Entry Template - IMPORTANT: Use an H3 heading as demonstrated below.\n### YYYY-MM-DD\n\n(Added/Updated/Deprecated/Removed) the (something. If the change requires consumers to change how they use an API, describe what they must do and explain why the API was changed.)\n-->\n\n### 2025-02-18\n\nAdds the `lastKey` parameter and response property for the List Workspaces endpoint. This is the new and \nrecommended way to get paginated workspace results. `pageSize` is used in conjunction with `lastKey` while `page`\nand `includeAll` remain deprecated and will be removed.\n\n### 2025-02-12\n\nRemoves `permalink` as a listed `include` option for GetFolder, GetWorkspace, and GetPersonalFolder as this option \nhas never been supported. \n\n### 2025-02-10\n\nThe GetWorkspace and GetFolder endpoint response objects have been updated for accuracy.\n\n### 2025-02-03\n\nTwo `include` options (`distributionLink` and `sheetVersion`) on the Get Workspace and Get Folder endpoints have \nbeen deprecated. The corresponding response properties will soon stop providing real values. \n\nThe description of another `include` option, `ownerInfo`, has been updated to clarify which user is returned when\nno user is an Owner on the asset.\n\nThe `loadAll` query parameter on the Get Workspace endpoint has been deprecated and will be removed. Use Get\nFolder calls to build out a workspace's structure.\n\n### 2025-02-01\n\nDeprecated: Marking `includeAll` and `page` params as deprecated for the List Workspace, List Workspace Folders, and List Folders in a Folder endpoints.\nResponse properties `pageNumber`, `totalCount`, and `totalPages` are also deprecated as they will no longer be relevant with the new pagination system.\n\n### 2025-01-22\n\nWebhooks are automatically disabled on sheets that exceed any of the scale limits\n\nScale limits:\n\n* 20,000 rows\n* 400 columns\n* 500,000 cells\n\nRelated resources:\n* [Webhook Status](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/webhooksDescription#section/Webhook-Status) has a new related status\n* [Webhook Error Codes](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/webhooksDescription#section/Webhook-Errors) has new related error codes\n\nTo keep webhooks enabled on a sheet, stay below the aforementioned limits.\n\nAs a sheet Owner, you can re-enable webhooks on a sheet by following these steps:\n1. Reduce the sheet size to within the aforementioned limits.\n1. Execute the [Update Webhook](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) method with the `enabled` body attribute set to `true`.\n\nRelated resources:\n* [Webhook Status](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/webhooksDescription#section/Webhook-Status) has a new related status.\n* [Webhook Error Codes](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/webhooksDescription#section/Webhook-Errors) has new related error codes.\n\n### 2024-10-14\n\nFor Smartsheet US and Smartsheet Regions Europe, a one-minute debounce was introduced to optimize event trigger handling in our Webhooks event callback API. It reduces traffic and prevents workflows from acting on incomplete or transitional data.\n\n### 2024-10-09\n\nUpdated the `WebContentWidgetContent.type` to the `WidgetWebContent` enum. The former enum `WEBCONTENT` was incorrect.\n\n# RESOURCES\n\nThe following sections specify Smartsheet resources, including resource objects and methods (endpoints).\n\n# Authentication\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->",

If you encounter an error, see [Rate Limiting](/#section/Work-at-Scale/Rate-Limiting).\n\n## Multipart Uploads\n\nA multipart upload request must include the following HTTP headers:\n\nHeader | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**Content-Length** | The length of the request payload.\n**Content-Type** | Must be set to **multipart/form-data**, and include the boundary string that separates the parts in the request payload.\n\nThe request body of a multipart upload request contains one or more parts, each part containing either JSON or a file to upload.\nThe request body must contain at least one part.\nEach part must start with the boundary string specified in the **Content-Type** request header, and must contain the following part headers:\n\nHeader | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**Content-Disposition** | Contains the following semicolon-delimited items:<ul><li>**form-data**</li><li>**name=\"*partname*\"**</li><li>**filename=\"*filename*\"** (only required for file parts)</li></ul>NOTE: Values specified in the Content-Disposition header must be URL-encoded.\n**Content-Type** | The content type of the part: **application/json** for JSON objects, or the applicable MIME type for file parts\n\nThe last part in the request must be followed by the boundary string, followed by two hyphens.\n\nThe documentation for each operation that supports multipart uploads specifies the number and names of parts that are expected for the operation.\nFile parts must have the part name \"file\", and documentation for operations which allow for JSON object parts specify the required part name for the JSON part.\n\nThe following example shows a multipart upload request that creates a comment containing the specified text and file attachment:\n\n`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/discussions/2889925487028100/comments`\n`Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}`\n`Content-Length: 29008`\n`Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`\n\n`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`\n`Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"comment\"`\n`Content-Type: application/json`\n\n`{ \"text\": \"Please review the attached image.\" }`\n`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`\n`Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"picture.jpg\"`\n`Content-Type: image/jpeg`\n\n*< Binary content for file >*\n`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr--`\n\nNOTE: Most programming languages have libraries that can be used to assemble multipart requests.\n\n## Simple Uploads\n\nTo perform this kind of upload, you must set specific headers to tell Smartsheet about the file. The following three headers are required:\n\nHeader | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**Content-Disposition** | **attachment** to tell the API that a file is in the body of the `POST` request, followed by a semicolon, followed by **filename=** and the URL-encoded filename in quotes\n**Content-Length** | Must be set to the size of the file, in bytes. For example to determine file size using in UNIX: <p>`$ ls -l ProgressReport.docx`<br/>`5463 ProgressReport.docx`</p>\n**Content-Type** | Can be left blank if it is not known (but must be present); Smartsheet makes its best guess based on the extension of the file.\n\nThe following example request shows a simple upload that adds a file attachment to a sheet:\n\n`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/attachments`\n`Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}`\n`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"ProgressReport.docx\"`\n`Content-Type: application/msword`\n`Content-Length: 5463`\n\n*< Binary content for file >*\n\nAs shown in this example, the contents of the file is included in the body of the `POST` request. In most programming languages, this is done by reading the file from an input stream and writing it out to the output stream of the HTTP request.\n"

			"description": "# Cell Links\n\nCreating or updating cell links via the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is a special operation.\nA given row or cell update operation may contain only link updates, or no link updates.\nAttempting to mix row/cell updates with cell link updates results in error code 1115.\nAdditionally, a [CellLink object](/tag/cellsObjects#section/CellLink-Object) can only be added to an existing cell, so the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is not allowed when POSTing a new row to a sheet.\n\nWhen creating a cell link, **cell.value** must be null (the data is pulled from the linked cell).\n\nA cell may not contain both a hyperlink and a cell link, so **hyperlink** and **linkInFromCell** may never both be non-null at the same time.\n\n# Cell Reference\n\n## Cell Value Representation\n\n[Cell objects](/tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object) retrieved through the Smartsheet APIs have two main attributes representing cell values: **Cell.value**, and\n**Cell.displayValue**. A third attribute, **Cell.objectValue** is currently used only for adding and updating predecessors, or for multi-contact or multi-picklist details, such as email addresses or values in a multi-picklist. An empty cell returns no value.\n\n**Cell.displayValue** is always a string and is only returned for certain column types (see below).  It represents the formatted value as it should\nbe displayed to an end-user.  For example, if a TEXT_NUMBER column is formatted as a US Dollar currency, its **value** may be a number\nlike 1234.5678, but its **displayValue** is \"$1,234.57\".\n\n**Cell.value** represents a cell's raw value and can be one of the following primitive JSON types: string, number, or Boolean,\ndepending on the column type.  An empty cell returns no value. Complex types are represented as strings, formatted as described below:\n\n[Help with Project Columns](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765737-project-sheet-columns-start-date-end-date-duration-complete-and-predecessors)\n\nColumn Type | Possible Types for Cell.value | Returns Cell.displayValue?\n------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------\nABSTRACT_DATETIME | string: a project date and time in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>number: see [Dates and Times](/#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.\nCHECKBOX | Boolean: **true** if the checkbox is checked, **false** if unchecked, no value if the cell hasn't been touched yet.<br/>string: a free-form text value. | No.\nCONTACT_LIST | string: an email address representing a contact, or a free-form text value. | Yes: same as **value** for free-form strings; for contacts, the contact's name if any, else their email address.\nDATE | string: a date in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>number: see [Dates and Times](/#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.\nDURATION | string: a duration value such as \"4d 6h 30m\" in the user's locale, or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on durations. | Yes: same as **value**\nMULTI_CONTACT_LIST | string: only visible when using a query parameter of **level** and the value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying, otherwise the column type is TEXT_NUMBER. | Yes: same as **value**; to see actual email addresses, see below.\nMULTI_PICKLIST | string: only visible when using a query parameter of **level** and the value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying, otherwise the column type is TEXT_NUMBER. | Yes: same as **value**; to see objectValue, see below.\nPICKLIST | string: one of the picklist's column options, or a free-form text value.<br/>number: numeric values | Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.\nPREDECESSOR\t| string: a comma-delimited predecessor list such as \"12FS +3d 4h, 14SS\", or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on predecessors. | Yes: same as **value**\nTEXT_NUMBER\t| string: free-form text values<br/>number: numeric values | Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.\n\n**Cell.objectValue** is an object representation of a cell's value and is currently used for adding or updating predecessor cell values, or for multi-contact details, such as email addresses.\n\n* For predecessors, it provides a more \"programmer friendly\" format for assembling predecessors. To update a cell's predecessors, set **objectValue** to a\n[PredecessorList object](/tag/cellsObjects#section/PredecessorList-Object) containing [Predecessor objects](/tag/cellsObjects#section/Predecessor-Object).\n* For multi-contact or multi-picklist details, use both a level query parameter *and* an **include=objectValue** query to see email addresses rather than display names or to see multi-picklist values.\n\n## Cell Value Parsing\n\nThe flexibility in cell value data types is a powerful feature in the Smartsheet application; however, it poses a challenge\nfor an API in terms of parsing. Being too flexible might result in unexpected behavior. For instance, if you write code\nto post a Date value to a Smartsheet and the API operation succeeds, you might assume that the date value you sent was interpreted\nas date. What happens if you posted your date in the wrong format? Do you really want Smartsheet to keep the malformed date\nas a string value? Probably not.\n\nTo address this problem, the Smartsheet API employs a simple scheme to indicate whether you want a more predictable and strict\ninterface or a more flexible one. By default, a cell value is expected to conform to \"strict\" rules for the type of the cell's column.\nIf an input value doesn't conform, the API returns [error code 1042](/#section/Error-Codes/400-Level-Error-Codes).\n\nIf, however, you want the same flexibility as the Smartsheet Web app, you can disable the strict rules, and we’ll do our best to make\nsense of it. To enable lenient parsing simply include **\"strict\": false** in the [Cell object](/tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object) in your request body.\n\nNOTE: How does strict cell value parsing compare to cell validation settings? Strict cell value parsing determines how string values are parsed. It is set on a per-call basis. In contrast, cell validation is part of the column definition. The <b>overrideValidation</b> property is restricted to sheet admins and does <i>not</i> override strict parsing.\n\nThe parsing rules for the various column types are as follows:\n\n**ABSTRACT_DATETIME**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**lenient** | Smartsheet attempts to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, Smartsheet recognizes the date and stores it as such. All other values are simply text values.\n**strict** | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD). Alternatively, if Unix time (also known as epoch time) is used, you can use the query parameter of **numericDates** set to **true** to have Smartsheet convert epoch time to human readable dates. See [Dates and Times](/#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times) for more information.\n\n**CHECKBOX**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**lenient** | Boolean values and string values of **true** and **false** are handled the same as **strict**. All other values are saved as text values.\n**strict** | Only Boolean values (true or false) are valid.\n\n**CONTACT_LIST**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**lenient** | If the value is a valid email address, Smartsheet handles it the same as **strict**. If not, Smartsheet saves the value as a text value.\n**strict** | The value must be a valid email address. If **displayValue** is set, Smartsheet uses that as the name; otherwise, if Smartsheet finds a match among the the access token owner's contacts, Smartsheet associates this cell with that existing contact.\n\nNOTE: See [Contact List Columns](/#section/Cell-Reference/Contact-List-Columns) for more information.\n\n**DATE**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**lenient** | Smartsheet attempts to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, Smartsheet recognizes the date and stores it as such. All other values are simply text values.\n**strict** | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD). Alternatively, if Unix time (also known as epoch time) is used, you can use the query parameter of **numericDates** set to **true** to have Smartsheet convert epoch time to human readable dates. See [Dates and Times](/#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times) for more information.\n\n**DURATION**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**lenient** | Numeric values are treated as duration values in days. String values which are valid duration strings in the user's locale are treated as durations, and any other values are treated as free-form text values.\n**strict** | Only valid duration strings in the user's locale are valid. Information on duration strings can be found in [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>).\n\nNOTE: You may use the query string parameter <b>projectParseLocale</b> with a [supported locale string](/tag/serverInfoDescription) to force parsing in the specified locale (for example, using <b>en_US</b> lets you send in English values regardless of the user's locale).\n\n**MULTI_CONTACT_LIST**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\nN/A | Set using the **objectValue** attribute for the Cell object, which is inherently strict. See [Cell Reference](/tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).\n\n**MULTI_PICKLIST**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\nN/A | Set using the **objectValue** attribute for the Cell object, which is inherently strict. See [Cell Reference](/tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).\n\n**PICKLIST**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**lenient** | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers are parsed like TEXT_NUMBER formatted numbers.\n**strict** | The value must be a string and must be one of the options for the picklist.\n\n**PREDECESSOR**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\nN/A | Set using the **objectValue** attribute for the Cell object, which is inherently strict. See [Cell Reference](/tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).\n\n**TEXT_NUMBER**\n\nValue | Description |\n-----|-----|\n**lenient** | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers passed as text values, such as currencies (\"$5,000\"), percentages (\"50%\"), or decimals (\"100.5\") are parsed to their numeric equivalents, based on the locale of the access token owner,  with the proper formatting enabled for the cell.\n**strict** | All numeric and text values are valid and are interpreted literally.\n\nNOTE: The Smartsheet application only supports numeric values in the range -9007199254740992 to 9007199254740992. If using strict parsing, any numeric value outside that range results in [error code 1148](/#section/Error-Codes/400-Level-Error-Codes). If using lenient parsing, the value is silently converted to text.\n\n## Contact List Columns\n\nWith columns of type **CONTACT_LIST**, the cell attributes **value** and **displayValue** are treated independently.\nThe contact’s email address is represented by **value**, while the contact’s name (and the value displayed in the cell in the Smartsheet app) is represented by **displayValue**.\n\nWhen creating or updating cells for a contact list column, the **displayValue** attribute works as follows:\n\n* If **displayValue** is non-null and non-empty, the Smartsheet cell displays the value provided.\n* If **displayValue** is an empty string, the Smartsheet cell displays the email address.\n* If **displayValue** is null or absent, Smartsheet makes a best guess effort at filling it in with a contact’s name based on the email address.\n\n# Hyperlinks\n\nYou can create and modify [hyperlinks](/tag/cellsObjects#section/Hyperlink-Object) by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data.\nWhen creating or updating a hyperlink, **cell.value** may be set to a string value or null.\nIf null, the cell's value is derived from the hyperlink:\n\n* If the hyperlink is a URL link, the cell's value is set to the URL itself.\n* If the hyperlink is a dashboard, report, or sheet link, the cell's value is set to the dashboard, report, or sheet name.\n\n## Images in Cells\n\nFor details about working with images in cells, see [Cell Images](/tag/cellImagesDescription).\n"

Only visible when using a query parameter of **level** and the value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying. To see email addresses behind the display names, combine an **include=objectValue** query parameter with a **level** query parameter.\nDate\t\t\t| **DATE** |\nDate/Time \t\t| **ABSTRACT_DATETIME** | Represents a project sheet's start and end dates.<br/>**Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a column to this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet Web app when configuring a project sheet.) Additionally, the API does not support updating data in the \"End Date\" column under any circumstance, and does not support updating data in the \"Start Date\" column if \"Predecessor\" is set for that row.\nDate/Time\t\t| **DATETIME**\t| Used only by the following system-generated columns: <ul><li>Created (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = **CREATED_DATE**)</li><li>Modified (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = **MODIFIED_DATE**)</li></ul>\nDropdown List\t| **PICKLIST**\t| Custom, RYG, Harvey ball, priority types, etc.\nDropdown List\t| **MULTI_PICKLIST**\t| List where single cells can contain more than one dropdown item. Only visible when using a query parameter of **level** and the value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying. To see multi-picklist values behind the display names, combine an **include=objectValue** query parameter with a **level** query parameter.\nDuration\t\t| **DURATION**\t\t| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a column to this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet Web app when configuring a project sheet.)\nPredecessor\t\t| **PREDECESSOR**\t| Defines what must happen first in a project flow. For more information, see the [Predecessor object](/tag/cellsObjects#section/PredecessorList-Object). **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**\nText/Number\t\t| **TEXT_NUMBER**\t|\n\nNOTE: See the [Cell Reference](/tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference) section for information on getting and setting cell values for the different column types.\n\n## Symbol Columns\n\nIn addition to the basic column types above, the Smartsheet app also supports columns that display symbols. These are specialized columns of type **CHECKBOX** or **PICKLIST**,\nwhose **symbol** attribute is set to one of the values below:\n\n**Symbols for CHECKBOX columns:**\n\nValue | Example |\n-----|-----|\n**FLAG** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_flagc.png\" alt=\"A flag symbol\" /> |\n**STAR** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_starc.png\" alt=\"A star symbol\" /> |\n\n**Symbols for PICKLIST columns:**\n\nValue | Example |\n-----|-----|\n**ARROWS_3_WAY** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_arrows3.png\" alt=\"An arrows_3_way symbol\" /> |\n**ARROWS_4_WAY** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_arrows4.png\" alt=\"An arrows_4_way symbol\" /> |\n**ARROWS_5_WAY** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_arrows5.png\" alt=\"An arrows_5_way symbol\" /> |\n**DECISION_SHAPES** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_decisionshapes.png\" alt=\"A decision_shapes symbol\" /> |\n**DECISION_SYMBOLS** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_decisionsymbols.png\" alt=\"A decision_symbols symbol\" /> |\n**DIRECTIONS_3_WAY** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_directions3.png\" alt=\"A directions_3_way symbol\" /> |\n**DIRECTIONS_4_WAY** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_directions4.png\" alt=\"A directions_4_way symbol\" /> |\n**EFFORT** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_effort6Three.png\" alt=\"An effort symbol\" /> |\n**HARVEY_BALLS** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_harvey5.png\" alt=\"A harvey_balls symbol\" /> |\n**HEARTS** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_heart6Three.png\" alt=\"A hearts symbol\" /> |\n**MONEY** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_money6Three.png\" alt=\"A money symbol\" /> |\n**PAIN** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_pain6.png\" alt=\"A pain symbol\" /> |\n**PRIORITY** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_priority.png\" alt=\"A priority symbol\" /> |\n**PRIORITY_HML** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_priorityhml.png\" alt=\"A priority_hml symbol\" /> |\n**PROGRESS** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_progress5Half.png\" alt=\"A progress symbol\" /> |\n**RYG** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_ryg.png\" alt=\"An RYG symbol\" /> |\n**RYGB** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_rygb.png\" alt=\"An RYGB symbol\" /> |\n**RYGG** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_rygg.png\" alt=\"An RYGG symbol\" /> |\n**SIGNAL** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_signal5.png\" alt=\"A signal symbol\" /> |\n**SKI** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_difficulty4.png\" alt=\"A ski symbol\" /> |\n**STAR_RATING** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_star6Three.png\" alt=\"A star_rating symbol\" />\n**VCR** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_decisionvcr.png\" alt=\"A VCR symbol\" /> |\n**WEATHER** | <img src=\"/images/img_pl_weather5.png\" alt=\"A weather symbol\" /> |\n\nNOTE: The Smartsheet grid user interface presents several row attributes and features visually as columns, for example, attachments, discussions, row action indicator, or row number.  The API does not consider these to be columns, and does not return or otherwise expose them as columns.  The only columns returned by the API are user data columns.\n\n## System Columns\n\nIn addition to the standard column types and symbols, Smartsheet has a number of system columns, which represent data that is\nfilled in by Smartsheet and whose values cannot be changed by the user. These columns are represented with standard\n[column types](/tag/columnsRelated#section/Column-Types), with the **[Column.systemColumnType](/tag/columnsObjects#section/Column-Object)** attribute set to one of the following:\n\nColumn.systemColumnType Value | Column Type | Notes\n-----|-----|-----|\n**AUTO_NUMBER** | TEXT_NUMBER | Columns of this system column type include an [AutoNumberFormat object](/tag/commonObjects#section/AutoNumberFormat-Object) that describes the mask used to generate the value.\n**CREATED_BY**  | CONTACT_LIST\n**CREATED_DATE** | DATETIME\n**MODIFIED_BY** | CONTACT_LIST\n**MODIFIED_DATE** | DATETIME\n"

Examples of events are create, update, load, and delete of sheets, reports, dashboards, attachments, and users. Note: while the current list of events covers most of Smartsheet functionality, new events will be added to the list as Smartsheet introduces new functionality.\n\nSome actions in Smartsheet are performed by system components. Therefore, the userId property in some response payloads refers to a system user and not to a regular user. For example, the Smartsheet Events API shows 5629504736520068 as the userId when an anonymous user accesses a sheet that is published for anyone.\n\nThe list of system users is displayed below. New system userIds may be incorporated to this list as new features and subsystems are incorporated to Smartsheet:\n\nSystem user | Description |\n-----|-----|\n1688855062570884 | Data accessed/modified by Skype action (only possible if Smartsheet account is connected to Skype) |\n2814754969413508 | Data accessed/modified by Trello import action (only possible if Smartsheet account is connected to Trello) |\n3377704922834820 | Data accessed/modified due to Smartsheet cell-link |\n3940654876256132 | Data accessed/modified by the Smartsheet Automation system |\n5066554783098756 | Access to object published to any user in the Smartsheet organization account |\n5629504736520068 | Access to Smartsheet object published to anyone |\n6192454689941380 | Data accessed/modified by the Smartsheet Notification system |\n7881304550205316 | Data accessed/modified by Smartsheet Form submission |\n\nSee <a href=\"https://smartsheet-platform.github.io/event-reporting-docs/\" target=\"_blank\">Event Reporting reference documentation</a> for details on each event type.\n\nSee [Authentication and Access Tokens](/#section/API-Basics/Authentication-and-Access-Tokens) for more information.\n\nNOTE: Event Reporting is a premium add-on which can be purchased for Enterprise and Advance Platinum plans only.

If specified, the value of the **include** parameter is\na comma-delimited list of flags that indicate additional attributes to be included in each [Row object](/tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object) within the response.\n\nInclude Flag | Description |\n-------------|-------|\n**attachments**\t| Includes row **attachments** array.<br/>To include discussion attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include list.\n**columnType**\t| Includes **columnType** attribute in the row's [cells](/tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object) indicating the type of the column the cell resides in.\n**discussions**\t| Includes row **discussions** array.<br/>To include discussion attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include list.\n**filters**\t\t| Includes **filteredOut** attribute indicating if the row should be displayed or hidden according to the sheet's filters.\n**format**\t\t| Includes **format** attribute on the row, its cells, or summary fields.  See [Formatting](/#section/API-Basics/Formatting).\n**objectValue** | Includes **objectValue** attribute on cells containing values. For more information see [Cell Reference](/tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).\n**rowPermalink** | Includes **permalink** attribute that represents a direct link to the [row](/tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object) in the Smartsheet application.\n**rowWriterInfo** | **DEPRECATED** Includes **createdBy** and **modifiedBy** attributes on the row, indicating the row's creator, and last modifier.\n**writerInfo** | Includes **createdBy** and **modifiedBy** attributes on the row or summary fields, indicating the row or summary field's creator, and last modifier.\n\n# Specify Row Location\n\nWhen you [add a row](/tag/rows#operation/rows-addToSheet), the default behavior is for Smartsheet to put the new row at the bottom of the sheet. And when you [update a row](/tag/rows#operation/update-rows), the default behavior is to keep the row where it is. It is not necessary to use a location-specifier attribute if you want the default behavior.\n\nTo specify a location for new or updated rows other than the defaults, use the table below for reference. The table details possible row locations and provides JSON examples to help you construct one or more [Row objects](/tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object) with location-specifier attributes.\n\nNote the following restrictions:\n\n* Use only one location-specifier attribute per request, unless you use **parentId** and **toBottom** or **siblingId** and **above**.\n* If you specify multiple rows in the request, all rows must have the same location-specifier attributes.\n* If you specify the **parentId** attribute, you cannot also specify the **siblingId** attribute.\n* If you specify the **siblingId** attribute, you cannot also specify the **parentId**, **toTop**, or **toBottom** attributes.\n* If you want to indent or outdent multiple rows, use the **parentId** attribute.\n\nDestination | Row Attributes | Examples |\n-------|--------|--------|\nTop of a sheet | **toTop** | ```(\"toTop\": true}```\nBottom of a sheet | **toBottom** | ```(\"toBottom\": true}```\nTop of an indented section a.k.a., first child row | **parentId** | ```(\"parentId\": 8896508249565060}```\nBottom of an indented section a.k.a., last child row | **parentId** +<br/>**toBottom** | ```{\"parentId\": 8896508249565060, \"toBottom\": true}```\nBelow a specific row, at the same indent level | **siblingId** | ```{\"siblingId\": 8896508249565060}```\nAbove a specific row, at the same indent level | **siblingId** +<br/>**above** | ```{\"siblingId\": 8896508249565060, \"above\": true}```\nIndent one existing row, must have a value of \"1\" | **indent** | ```{\"indent\": 1}```\nOutdent one existing row, must have a value of \"1\" | **outdent** | ```{\"outdent\": 1}```\n"

Your application subscribes to [callbacks](/#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Event-Callbacks).</span><br/>First, subscribe to event notifications (callbacks) by creating one or more webhooks.  You can create a webhook manually via the API or have your application create a webhook dynamically.  Each webhook must specify:\n    * Which Smartsheet object to monitor for events\n    * Which events in that object should trigger a callback\n    * The HTTPS URL (that is, \"callback URL\") where Smartsheet should send callbacks\nwhen any of the specified events occur within the scope of the specified Smartsheet object. (<b>NOTE:</b> Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers using self-signed certificates)\n\n\t  <b>Webhook examples in plain English:</b>\n\n\t  * \"When any changes occur in Sheet_A, send a callback to https://www.example.com/abc\"\n\n\t  * \"When a new row is added to Sheet_B, send a callback to https://www.example.com/def\"\n\n\t  * \"When a cell value is changed in Sheet_C, send a callback to https://www.example.com/ghi\"\n\n\n2. When any of the specified events occur within an object that is being monitored by a webhook, Smartsheet sends an <b>HTTP POST</b> (that is, \"callback\") to the callback URL that is associated with the webhook.\n\n\t  * NOTE: The callback payload is a \"skinny\" payload -- it indicates which objects\nchanged and the type of events that occurred, but does not contain any data from the objects themselves.\n3. Your application receives, acknowledges, and processes callbacks.</span><br/>Your application receives the <code>HTTP POST</code>, acknowledges the callback by responding with HTTP status 200, and processes the callback. Because the callbacks are \"skinny\", make one or more requests to the Smartsheet API to retrieve the actual data associated with the change.\n\n## Webhook Management\n\nUse the Smartsheet API to create and manage webhooks. See [Webhooks API Reference](/tag/webhooksDescription) for details about the related API operations.\n\n## Webhook Ownership & Access\n\n> **IMPORTANT:** Webhooks are automatically disabled on sheets that exceed 20,000 rows, 400 columns, or 500,000 cells (whichever comes first). Stay within the specified limits to keep webhooks enabled on your sheets.\n\nWebhooks can be created and managed via [Direct API Access](/tag/webhooksDescription) or by a [third-party app](/#section/Third-party-App-Development).\n\nA webhook that is created via Direct API Access:\n\n* is owned by the user who created it\n* can be managed only by the user who created it\n* is not affected if the access token that was used to create it is revoked, as long as the user remains active\n\nA webhook that is created by a third-party app:\n\n* is owned by the user who authorized the third-party app (and is associated with the third-party app)\n* can be managed by the third-party app (as long as it maintains authorization) or by the user who owns it\n* is permanently disabled if the third-party app's permissions are revoked\n\n## Webhook Scope & Events\n\nA webhook monitors the specified **scope** for the specified **events**.\n\nA [Webhook object's](/tag/webhooksObjects#section/Webhook-Object) **scope** attribute indicates the scope of the subscription. It is specified when [creating a webhook](/tag/webhooksDescription#section/Creating-a-Webhook), and cannot subsequently be changed.\n\n* Currently, **sheet** is the only supported value for the **scope** attribute. However, you can set an array of columns as a **subscope** if you want to limit the webhook to specific columns.\n\nA [Webhook object's](/tag/webhooksObjects#section/Webhook-Object) **event** attribute indicates the set of events that a webhook is subscribed to (that is, which events trigger a callback).\n\n* Events are represented as a dot-separated string in the format \"*object*.*event*\", where an asterisk (&#42;) can be used to represent \"all objects\" or \"all events\".\n* Currently, <b>&#42;.&#42;</b> is the only supported value for the **events** attribute. This indicates a subscription to all objects in the scope, and all events for those objects.\n\nNOTE: When a row is deleted on a sheet, even if you are using a <b>subscope</b> to monitor columns only and the cell in that column for that row is empty, you will receive a \"row.deleted\" event.\n\n## Example\n\nConsider a [Webhook object](/tag/webhooksObjects#section/Webhook-Object) with the following attribute values:\n\n* **scopeObjectId** = 12345678901234\n* **scope** = \"sheet\"\n* **events** = \"&#42;.&#42;\"\n\nThis webhook monitors the specified sheet (id: 12345678901234) for all types of events. For example, if a row is added to the sheet, cell values are updated in the sheet, a column is deleted from the sheet, etc., a callback is sent to the webhook's **callbackUrl**.\n\n# Creating a Webhook\n\nAn API client can create a webhook by using the [Create Webhook](/tag/webhooks#operation/createWebhook) operation. A newly created webhook is disabled by default.\nAfter successfully creating a webhook, the API client must subsequently initiate and complete the [verification process](/tag/webhooksDescription#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification) before the webhook is enabled.\nThe following diagram illustrates the process of creating and enabling a webhook.\n\n<img src=\"/images/v4-CreateAndEnableWebhook.png\" alt=\"Workflow to create a webhook\" />\n\n## Step-by-Step\n\nThe process occurs synchronously:\n\n1. API client submits a [Create Webhook](/tag/webhooks#operation/createWebhook) request.\n\n2. Smartsheet creates the webhook, but does not initially enable the webhook (**enabled: false** and **status: \"NEW_NOT_VERIFIED\"**).\n\n3. To initiate the verification process, the API client submits an [Update Webhook](/tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) request to specify **enabled: true**. (**NOTE:** The API client does not receive a response to this request until the verification process (steps 4 and 5) has completed.)\n\n4. When Smartsheet receives the request to enable the webhook, it sends a [verification request](/#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification) to the subscriber (that is, to the **callbackUrl** that the API client specified in the Create Webhook request).\nThe request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** header and contains only **challenge** and **webhookId** in the request body. The **challenge** value is a repeat of the header value for API clients that don't interpret header values.\n\n5. The subscriber responds to the verification request by echoing back the same unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response. For API clients that don't interpret header values, you can also send a JSON body with a **smartsheetHookResponse** attribute and the same value that would have been in the header.\n\n6. Once the subscriber has successfully acknowledged the verification request, Smartsheet enables the webhook and responds to the API client's Update Webhook request to confirm that the webhook has been enabled (**enabled: true** and **status: \"ENABLED\"**).\n\n## Webhook Verification\n\nWhen an API client attempts to enable a webhook, Smartsheet sends a verification request to the webhook's **callbackUrl** to verify that the subscriber expects and is able to successfully receive callbacks.\nThe request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** header and contains a JSON object in the request body with only **challenge** and **webhookId** attributes in the request body. The **challenge** attribute is a repeat of the header value for API clients that don't interpret header values.\n\n* To verify the webhook, the subscriber's response to the verification request must return a 200 HTTP status code and must echo back the same unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response or with a JSON **smartsheetHookResponse** attribute. Once Smartsheet receives this verification response, the webhook is enabled (**enabled: true** and **status: \"ENABLED\"**).\n\n* If the subscriber does not successfully respond to the verification request, the webhook remains disabled (**enabled: false** and **status: \"DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED\"**).\n\nWhen a webhook is initially [created through the API](/#operation/createWebhook), the response contains the webhook's Id.  If you wish to guarantee that your server only receives callbacks for webhooks that you created,\nyou can check the verification request's **webhookId** attribute against your list of created webhook Ids.  If the Id is not in the list, return a response with a non-200 status code (for example, 403 Forbidden),\nand the webhook that initiated the verification request is disabled as described above.\n\nNOTE: <b>IMPORTANT:</b> ONGOING VERIFICATION. Once a webhook has been enabled, Smartsheet sends a verification request to the webhook's <b>callbackUrl</b> once every 100 callbacks. The subscriber should respond to the verification request as described above -- failure to do so results in the webhook being disabled (<b>enabled: false</b> and <b>status: \"DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED\"</b>).\n\n## Duplicate Webhooks\n\n*Duplicate webhooks* are defined as two or more webhooks that meet the following conditions:\n\n* on the same sheet\n* created by the same user\n* have identical: **callbackUrl** and **subscope** properties.\n\nBecause duplicate webhooks are functionally identical, this would ordinarily result in the callback URL being called simultaneously once for each duplicate webhook in the sheet when the sheet changes. Many duplicates can lead to too much traffic which can cause a *denial of service* (DOS) on the callback server.\n\nThere are no known valid use cases for duplicate webhooks; they are usually created unintentionally by API clients due to faulty or missing logic.\n\nFor this reason, **as of January 2023, Smartsheet will now deduplicate webhook callbacks**.  This means for every set of duplicate webhooks on a sheet, Smartsheet will no longer issue one callback per webhook, and will instead only issue **one total callback**, for only the oldest enabled webhook.\n\n**Recommendation:** When creating a webhook, first check to make sure that the sheet doesn't already contain an identical webhook.  If it does, and it's disabled, re-enable it.  If it's already enabled, do nothing.\n\n# Webhook Status\n\nA [Webhook](/#section/Webhook-Object) object's **enabled** attribute indicates whether a webhook is enabled or disabled, while the **status** attribute describes the *reason* that the webhook is enabled or disabled.\n\nThe following table lists all possible combinations of **enabled** and **status** attribute values.\n\nWebhook.enabled | Webhook.status | Meaning | Notes\n----- | ----- | ------ | -----\nfalse  | **DISABLED_ADMINISTRATIVE** | Webhook has been disabled by Smartsheet support. | A webhook in this state can only be re-enabled by Smartsheet (contact <a href=\"mailto:api@smartsheet.com\">api@smartsheet.com</a>).  Attempting to re-enable a webhook in this state results in error code 1154.\nfalse  | **DISABLED_APP_REVOKED** | Webhook has been disabled because the third-party app associated with the webhook has had its access revoked. | This is a terminal state (that is, webhook in this state cannot be re-enabled, and attempts to do so result in error code 1153). If the third-party app's access is subsequently restored, it must create new webhooks.\nfalse  | **DISABLED_BY_OWNER** | Webhook has been disabled by the owner. | Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](/tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) operation to set **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](/#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification), the webhook is enabled.\nfalse  | **DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED** | Webhook has been disabled because callback was not successfully delivered to the callback URL. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](/tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) operation to set **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](/#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification), the webhook is enabled.\nfalse | **DISABLED_EXCEEDED_GRID_LIMITS** | Webhook has been disabled because the sheet has 20,000 rows, 400 columns, or 500,000 cells. | Owner can enable the webhook by first reducing the sheet size to within the specified limits and then executing the [Update Webhook](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) operation with the `enabled` body attribute set to `true`.\nfalse  | **DISABLED_SCOPE_INACCESSIBLE** | Webhook has been disabled because its owner lost access to the corresponding data in Smartsheet (either because the object was deleted or sharing permissions were revoked). | Webhook is automatically re-enabled if access to data is restored (for example, if deleted object is restored or sharing permissions are restored).\nfalse  | **DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED** | Webhook verification has failed. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](/tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) operation to set **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](/#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification), the webhook is enabled.\ntrue  | **ENABLED** | Webhook is active. |\nfalse | **NEW_NOT_VERIFIED** | Webhook has been created but is not enabled because it has not yet been verified. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](/tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) operation to set **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](/#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification), the webhook is enabled.\n\n**NOTES:**\n\n* When a Webhook object's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <b>true</b>, Smartsheet is monitoring for the specified events and sends a [callback](/#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Event-Callbacks) to the <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur.\n* When a Webhook object's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <b>false</b>, Smartsheet is not monitoring for the specified events and does not send a callback to the <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur. Depending on the value of the <b>status</b> attribute, it may be possible to (re-)enable the webhook. (See below for details).\n\n# Webhook Callbacks\n\nA callback is the notification that Smartsheet sends to a webhook's **callbackUrl**. There are two types of callbacks:\n\n* [Event callback](/#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Event-Callbacks): Alerts the subscriber when the specified events have occurred in Smartsheet. This is the most common type of callback.\n\n* [Status Change callback](/#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Status-Change-Callbacks): Alerts the subscriber that a webhook has been automatically disabled due to loss of access or automatically re-enabled due to restoration of access.\n\nA Subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (that is, ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the identity of its sender (that is, ensure that the callback did indeed originate from Smartsheet).\nFor more information, see [Authenticating Callbacks](/#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Authenticating-Callbacks-(optional)).\n\n**NOTES:**\n\n* Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers using self-signed certificates. The callback server must be using a signed certificate from a certificate authority.\n* The callbackURL cannot be a private IP address.\n* The callbackURL must use one of the following ports: 443 (default for HTTPS), 8000, 8008, 8080, or 8443.\n* Smartsheet webhooks alway let a running callback for a given sheet finish before making another, that is the second call will wait on the first one to finish.\n\n## Event Callbacks\n\nSmartsheet sends an event callback to notify the subscriber when the specified events occur in Smartsheet.\n\n**WARNING:** Any events that occur while a webhook is disabled are not communicated via callback if/when webhook is enabled.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** For Smartsheet US and Smartsheet Regions Europe since October 14th 2024, a one-minute debounce was introduced to optimize event trigger handling in the Webhooks event callback API. It reduces traffic and prevents workflows from acting on incomplete or transitional data.\n\n## Callback Acknowledgement\n\nThe subscriber must respond to an event callback with a 200 [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success) to acknowledge that the callback was received.\n\n## Retry Logic\n\nIf the subscriber fails to respond with a 200 status, depending on the response, Smartsheet may retry delivery up to 14 times. (The first 7 retry attempts occur with a frequency that's determined using exponential backoff; thereafter, retry attempts occur once every three hours until all retries have been exhausted.)\n\nSubscriber response | Is retried?\n----- | -----\nHTTP 201 through 299 | No\nHTTP 309 through 399 | No\nHTTP 400 through 499 (except 410) | Yes\nHTTP 410 | No\nHTTP 500 through 599 | Yes\nAny other HTTP status | No\nRequest timeout | Yes\n\nIf the response is not retriable or retry attempts have been exhausted, the webhook is disabled (**enabled: false** and **status: \"DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED\"**).\nA webhook in this state can be re-enabled if the subscriber completes the verification process. (See [Webhook Status](/#section/Webhook-Status) for details.)\n\n## Status Change Callbacks\n\nIf a webhook's owner loses access to the object that a webhook is monitoring (either because the object was deleted or the webhook owner's access to the object was revoked in Smartsheet),\nSmartsheet automatically disables the webhook and sends a status change callback to alert the subscriber of this change in status.\nThe **newWebhookStatus** attribute indicates that the webhook is now disabled (because the scope is inaccessible).\n\nIf the webhook owner's access to the object is subsequently restored,\nSmartsheet automatically re-enables the webhook and sends a status change callback to alert the subscriber of this change in status.\nThe **newWebhookStatus** attribute indicates that the webhook is now enabled.\n\n## Authenticating Callbacks (optional)\n\nA subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (that is, ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the identity of its sender (that is, ensure that the callback did indeed originate from Smartsheet).\n\nWhen you create a new [webhook](/#section/Webhook-Object), it is assigned a randomly generated **sharedSecret** value.  The shared secret is used by Smartsheet to sign callback payloads, and should not be shared with any third parties.\n\nTo authenticate a callback request:\n\n1. Calculate the [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) of the webhook's **sharedSecret** and the request body.  This must be done using the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) cryptographic hash algorithm.\n\n2. Format the calculated value as a string in base 16.\n\n3. Compare your result with the value of the **Smartsheet-Hmac-SHA256** header of the request.\n\nIf the values match, you can be sure the request originated from Smartsheet and that the data has not been tampered with.\n\nNOTE: For maximum security, you may also choose to [reset your webhook's shared secret](/tag/webhooks#operation/resetSharedSecret) at periodic intervals.\n\n# Preventing Infinite Loops\n\nIt's possible that an application which subscribes to callbacks (using webhooks) might react to those callbacks by using the API to make additional changes in Smartsheet.\nBut, consider the following scenario:\n\n1. **App1** creates a webhook to monitor **Sheet-A** for changes, specifying an **App-1** URL as the **callbackUrl** for the webhook.\n\n2. **App-1** updates **Sheet-A** using the API.\n\n3. Smartsheet detects that **Sheet-A** has changed and sends a callback to **App-1** (as the webhook specified).\n\n4. **App-1** processes the callback, and in the course of doing so, updates **Sheet-A** again using the API.\n\n5. Return to Step 3.\n\nTo protect against infinite loops like the one outlined above, Smartsheet introduced support for a new header that an API client can include with any API request that adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet.\nHere's how it works:\n\n* An API client includes the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header in any API request that adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet.\n  * The header value should be set to a string that the API client recognizes\nas identifying itself. * If any [event callbacks](/tag/webhooksObjects#section/CallbackEvent-Object) fire as a result of an API request that contains the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header, the value of the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header is included in the [callback](/tag/webhooksObjects#section/Callback-Object) in the value of the **changeAgent** attribute.\n* If a webhook subscriber receives a [callback](/tag/webhooksObjects#section/Callback-Object) that contains the **changeAgent** attribute, it should evaluate the attribute value:\n  * If the attribute value's comma-delimited list contains the subscriber API\nclient's change agent value, this indicates that the change which triggered the callback *was* caused by the subscriber itself, and the subscriber can choose to ignore the callback, thus preventing an infinite loop.\n  * Else, the change which triggered the callback was *not* caused by the subscriber\nitself, and if the subscriber is going to subsequently react to the callback by making a change in Smartsheet (via API request), the API client should append a comma and its own identifier to the original attribute value, and pass that value through using the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header of the API request. Doing so protects against cross-system infinite loops.\nNOTE: The <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header value has a maximum length of 512 characters. If its length exceeds 512 characters, the excess is trimmed from the front of the string, so that the most recent agent information remains.\n\n# Webhook Errors\n\nThe following table specifies the recommended action for each Smartsheet-specific error code.\nUse this information to implement error handling logic according to the following guidelines:\n\n* If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request.\n* If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request until the problem has been fixed.\n* If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.\n\nHTTP status code | Smartsheet errorCode | Smartsheet message | Recommended Action |\n-----|-----|-----|-----|\n400 | 1151 | Scope '{0}', object id {1} was not found. | Do not retry without fixing the problem.\n400 | 1152 | Only URLs with a protocol of 'https' are supported for attribute '{0}'. | Do not retry without fixing the problem.\n400 | 5634 | You have reached the column limit of 20000 rows for this sheet. Webhooks are no longer enabled on this sheet. | Do not retry without bringing the sheet back to recommended size limits.\n400 | 5635 | You have reached the cell limit of 400 columns for this sheet. Webhooks are no longer enabled on this sheet. | Do not retry without bringing the sheet back to recommended size limits.\n400 | 5636 | You have reached the cell limit of 500000 cells for this sheet. Webhooks are no longer enabled on this sheet. | Do not retry without bringing the sheet back to recommended size limits.\n403 | 1153 | This webhook cannot be enabled because access was revoked for the application that created it. | <span class=\"doNotRetry\">Do not retry.</span>\n403 | 1154 | Please contact api@smartsheet.com in order to enable this webhook. | <span class=\"doNotRetry\">Do not retry.</span>\n"
